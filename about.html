            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Robot Wars is a 1v1 Lego robot battle tournament where players build robots and rise to the top. The
                game is hosted at STEM where you can come down and watch. Grab your popcorn, drinks, place your bets and
                watch the Lego wars commence!</p>
            <br />
            <p>Robot Wars has been running for 2 years, and has always created a fun and exciting tournament for viewers
                to watch! Robot Wars also inspires younger SPCC students to join us in STEM lunch club and even in the
                after-school STEM robots club!</p>
